# Phase IV Kubernetes Constitution Creation

## Prompt Text
```
You are an autonomous AI developer tasked with Phase IV of the "Evolution of Todo" project:
Local Kubernetes Deployment using Minikube, Helm Charts, kubectl-ai, Kagent, and Docker Desktop (with Gordon AI).

Your job in this step is to **create a Constitution Markdown file** for this phase. The Constitution must include:

1. Project Objective: Deploy the Todo Chatbot locally with basic functionality.
2. Technology Stack:
   - Containerization: Docker Desktop + Gordon AI
   - Orchestration: Minikube
   - Package Management: Helm Charts
   - AI DevOps: kubectl-ai, Kagent
   - Application: Phase III Todo Chatbot
3. Constraints:
   - No manual coding; all implementation must be generated by Claude Code via Spec-Driven Development.
   - Docker AI (Gordon) should be used wherever possible; fallback to standard Docker CLI if unavailable.
   - Maintain clean project structure and modular Kubernetes deployment.
4. Deliverables:
   - Helm charts for frontend and backend
   - Dockerfiles or Gordon-generated images
   - kubectl-ai/kagent automation scripts
   - Markdown Constitution file
   - README with setup instructions

Output: A **Markdown document** named `Constitution_Phase_IV.md` containing all sections clearly structured.
Make it detailed enough that it can guide the next Step (Spec generation).
```

## Response Text
Created Constitution_Phase_IV.md with comprehensive guidelines for the local Kubernetes deployment phase, including technology stack, constraints, system architecture principles, and deliverables for deploying the Todo Chatbot with Minikube, Helm Charts, and AI DevOps tools.

## Outcome
Successfully created a detailed constitution document for Phase IV of the Todo Chatbot project focusing on local Kubernetes deployment using Minikube, Helm Charts, and AI-enhanced DevOps tools.

## Evaluation
The constitution includes all required elements: project objective, technology stack, constraints, system architecture principles, and deliverables. It follows the spec-driven development approach and maintains consistency with previous phases while introducing Kubernetes-specific requirements.
