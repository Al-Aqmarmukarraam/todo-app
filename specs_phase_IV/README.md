# Phase IV: Todo Chatbot Kubernetes Deployment Specifications

This directory contains the detailed specifications for Phase IV of the Todo Chatbot project, which focuses on local Kubernetes deployment using Minikube, Helm Charts, and AI-enhanced DevOps tools.

## Overview

Phase IV aims to containerize the Todo Chatbot application and deploy it in a local Kubernetes environment. The specifications outline the requirements for:

- Containerizing the frontend and backend applications
- Creating Helm charts for deployment
- Implementing AI-assisted deployment automation
- Setting up intelligent optimization and monitoring
